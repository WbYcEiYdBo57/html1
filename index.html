    <h1>Godly Generator</h1>
    <!--Blake Edelen-->
    <p>I want to create a website for Dungeon Masters, world builders and even writers can go to if they have writers block or burnout. This website should help with creating Gods and everything surrounding them (like artifacts, religions, & the afterlife) in a world that people can enjoy.</p>
    <p>Here you can generate any random god for your world, setting, or whatever reason you need if you're burnt out or just out of ideas.</p>
    <p>You can generate their domain (what they rule over) and name.</p>

    <td><p style="color:navy;"> Here you can generate any random God or Goddess. It will even allow you to impose criteria if you're looking for something a little more specific.</p></td>
    <td><p style="color:navy;">Some Gods and Heroes have legendary artifacts that help them achieve their goals. Thor has Mjolnir, King Aurthur has Excalibur, and there are many more. If you need ideas for that, this generator is what you want to use. You can even narrow down what you want based on weapon, alignment and more.</p></td>
    <td><p style="color:navy;">Where do people go when they die? This generator can help you determine that for your world/story. You can have good and evil realms like Heaven and Hell, or maybe a realm with a restriction, like Valhalla.</p></td>

<!--I want to model after this site’s random generator. It has saved me countless times when I had writer’s block for a name for any character. It was the main inspiration for my idea, and I want to help others like it has helped me. It’s a very useful tool for anyone writing a story.-->

<!--This site has the overall structure of how I want my site to look. Not too busy, straight to the point and hyper links to each random generator. The generators have a count of how much to generate and an input on what to edit if you’re looking for something specific. I just wouldn’t ask for any personal information or have very many ads if at all.-->
